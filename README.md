# Hackers Poulette

This was a pretty fun project, it aims to learn how to secure a form as much as possible because this project will later be used by the cybersecurity class so that they can train on it. </br>
It was pretty tough for me to do it at first because I had no idea how to do it the right way and it was the first time I had to implement some strong security to my project. </br>
Basically we have a contact support form and the user must enter his name, firstname, email address and a description of the problem he encountered.</br>
The user can also upload a file if he wants but it's not mandatory. </br>
In case of wrong input, the form display a useful visual clue about the error, below the input field. </br>
As you can see there's a lot of things to validate and sanitize.
